# indoorSYs


	Welcome to my watering Indoor automated watering system. First of all, this is open source of couse and i will be uploading PCBs, schematics and code. 

	The heart of this project is an ESP8266 which will be used to host a web server and to control all the parameters of the indoor such as: temperature, humidity, soil humidity, water's pH and many more to add. 

	The web server will be used to wireless monitorate the indoor and take actions.
